# IDE

# Template
https://html5up.net/  
I choose the theme **Prologue** and **Multiverse**.  
Apart from it, [jekyllthemes](http://jekyllthemes.org/) and [hexo](https://hexo.io/themes/index.html) are popular to write up from **markdown** without duplicate html codes as well as compatitable with github.  
I give up hexo cause unexpected bugs and unqualified layout design.  
Basically, you can get access to most website source by download related pages.
